whirlenig
=========

Paper pocket-sized enigma-like crypto system.

The post script file is the program itself.

You need to initialise /ring1 /ring2 and /ring3 with a random permutation of the numbers 1--72 to make your own wiring.
At some point there should be a script that takes a pass-phrase and generates a .ps file with custom wiring derived from
a hash of the pass-phrase.
